    <h2>What Is Blockchain Technology?</h2>
    <p>
        Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information the digital ledger contains is highly secure.
    </p>
    <p>
        In simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network, in which, the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they can’t corrupt it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why is Blockchain Popular?
    </h2>
<p>
 <h3>Highly Secure</h3>
 It uses a digital signature feature to conduct fraud-free transactions making it impossible to corrupt or change the data of an individual by the other users without a specific digital signature.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Decentralized System</h3>
    Conventionally, you need the approval of regulatory authorities like a government or bank for transactions; however, with Blockchain, transactions are done with the mutual consensus of users resulting in smoother, safer, and faster transaction
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Automation Capability</h3>
    It is programmable and can generate systematic actions, events, and payments automatically when the criteria of the trigger are met.
